# NoReel - Disable the instagram reel feed
This app provides most of instagram features but without the reel feed for a better and healthier 
user experience. Reels are not blocked for your personal feed (those you follow) and 
direct messages (sent by other individuals). 

### Limitations
The app uses the web version of instagram and their limitations.
But the app is still well usable. If there are any other issues with limitations not listed here,
please feel free to write an [issue](https://github.com/Kalbra/noreel/issues/new).

Limitations are:
- Not available for IOS / Apple
- Long content loading time
- No instagram camera (only file upload)
- Less prettier UI than original instagram app
- General story creation limitations
  - No filters
  - No stickers
  - No music
  - (some others)


### Installation and releases
The app is only provided as APK file. It can be found [here](https://github.com/Kalbra/noreel/releases)

The APK file must be installed manually. A tutorial how to install an AKP file is linked
